# Adjustable 3D-Printed Desk Lamp

## Overview
The product is an adjustable and portable desk lamp designed to provide sufficient lighting. It is intended for students, hobbyists, and professionals working on small tasks, such as studying, late-night work, or fine-detail hobbies.

Notice: Lamp Base.SLDPRT and Lamp arm Project.SLDPRT were designed by a project partner (Nicholas Koltz).

## Design & Process
The lamp has pivoting arms, joints, fasteners, and a lightning cable slot which allows control over orientation, height, and easy replacement of the bulb.

The lamp had two iterations, with the first iteration completely failing. The base was not originally designed to have a hole for the wire, which was later added to make a more sleek design. Through all of these iterations, the problems were fixed, resulting in a complete, functional product.

## Materials & Manufacturing
The thin wall sections on the arms may cause print instability. The tolerances on the screw threads need very accurate printing, to ensure the screws go through.

Design for Assembly (DfA) improvements include replacing multiple screws with a rotary axle, allowing a click-and-insert process instead of traditional screwing, and making the lower dual arm perfectly symmetric to allow installation in any orientation.

Design for Manufacturing (DfM) considerations include hollowing the arms and base where possible to reduce material use and print time while maintaining stability.

Making the lower dual arms perfectly symmetric will also allow the part to be installed in any orientation, for user ease.

## Universal Design (UD) Considerations
The lamp requires low physical effort to adjust and assemble. Adjustable arms provide flexibility in use, and dual-sided threads allow orientation for either side of a user. Symmetry in parts reduces assembly errors and improves accessibility.

## Reflection & Next Steps
The final product performs well, with minor issues such as scratches on the lamp head due to PLA material. Next steps include improving the mechanisms, possibly changing to a sturdier material like PETG, and installing an actual light bulb.
